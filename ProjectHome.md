Like Edulinq, this project is purely for educational purposes. It will go through the types that the C# 5 compiler relies on to implement async methods, as well as investigating how to make awaitable types.

This is the essentially the code repository for the [Eduasync blog post series](http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/tags/Eduasync/default.aspx).
